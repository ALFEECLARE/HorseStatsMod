## Version 1.2.1 for Minecraft 1.16.x

- Fixed issue where right clicking a non tamed horse would show the stats of the latest ridden horse, and not the targeted one

## Version 1.2.0 for Minecraft 1.16.x

- Fixed the stats not showing when crouching and right clicking a horse
- It is now possible to get a horse's stats by crouching and right clicking it. **It only works if the horse is not tamed yet**

## Version 1.1.0 for Minecraft 1.16.x

*The config GUI has not been implemented by the Forge Team yet. To update the mod, you need to edit the config file in config/ folder of your minecraft directory*

- Now works with all 1.16 versions (it works with any other mod as well)
- Added a config file:
    - You can disable the stats from showing on the GUI. In that case, it will show the horse's stats when hovering its name (default: disabled)
    - You can disable the stats from showing with colors. In that case, it will use the default color (gray) (default: enabled)

## Version 1.0.0 for Minecraft 1.16.3

*Needs forge >= 34.0.6 (MC1.16.3)*
