## Version 1.1.0 for Minecraft 1.16.x

*The config GUI has not been implemented by the Forge Team yet. To update the mod, you need to edit the config file in config/ folder of your minecraft directory*

- Now works with all 1.16 versions (it works with any other mod as well)
- Added a config file:
    - You can disable the stats from showing on the GUI. In that case, it will show the horse's stats when hovering its name (default: disabled)
    - You can disable the stats from showing with colors. In that case, it will use the default color (gray) (default: enabled)
