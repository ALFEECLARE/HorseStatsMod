- Now works with all 1.16 versions (it works with any other mod as well)
- Added a config file:
    - You can disable the stats from showing on the GUI. In that case, it will show the horse's stats when hovering its name
    - You can disable the stats from showing with colors. In that case, it will use the default color (gray).
